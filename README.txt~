Team NJU-LAMDA For ChaLearn LAP. Apparent Personality Analysis: First Impressions Test Code

Operating System:
  Ubuntu Linux
Requirements:

  GPU With CUDA Support
  CUDNN
  MatConvNet v1.0.20
  LuaJIT
  Torch7 (with cunn, cutorch support)
  iTorch
  python2.7
  anaconda2
  python_speech_features: https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features
  libxgboost
  ipython
  itorch
  libffmpeg

Setup:

1. Extract Image From Video

   First, Put the Test Video file into /test folder like training. For example, /test/testing80_01/a.mp4

   Then, using MATLAB and execute readdata_test.m. It will extract image from video and put into /test_jpg/a.mp4/1.jpg, etc.

2. Extract Audio Feature From Video
   Suppose you have download all the data needed in the current folder, these will be many *.zip files.

   Extract wav files from the mp4 video files

     shell extract.sh                # Unzip all the *.zip files.
     shell mp42wav.sh                # Extract wav files from mp4 files in the current directory.

   Save these file into ./train_wav/ ./test_wav/ folders seperately

   Extract audio features from wav, each into a csv file.
   
     python wav2logfbank.py

   Concat those csv files into torch Tensors and save them to disk.
     cd ../data_logfbank/  
     th train2torch.lua              # Merge train csv files and save into disk.
3. Predict Model From Image

   First, in eval_val_reg_resnet.m,eval_val_reg_avg_max.m and eval_val_reg_avg_max_l28.m line 2, change MatConvNet location to your own MatConvNet location.

   Then execute 3 matlab file, You will get predictions_reg_avg_max_l28.csv, predictions_reg_avg_max.csv and predictions_reg_res.csv.

4. Predict Model From Audio
   jupyter notebook  # Open itorch notebook
   Open and run logreg.ipynb file   # This is the main file to train the audio model.
                                    # The trained model will be saved to disk to make prediction
   Make predictions
    th predict.lua                  # Make predictions on the test data. 
                                    # Note the y_test.csv file must be provided.
                                    # The final predictions file is predictions.csv.
5. csv Order Transform
   In this Step, we change the generate .csv before into correct order.

   First in Matlab, using uiimport to import the generate .csv file,

   Then import correct examples like training_gt.csv or provided predictions_val.csv(only uiimport name column and rename it to VideoName_test.

   Then change the transform.m Line 1 to change the generated file name for the csv.

   It will output csv file in correct order.

6. Score Fusion and Output 
   First, We use uiimport to import all csv file into Matlab(including redictions_reg_avg_max_l28.csv, predictions_reg_avg_max.csv and predictions_reg_res.csv and y_test.csv).

   Then Run the fusion.m, you will get the final output(predicitions.csv).
